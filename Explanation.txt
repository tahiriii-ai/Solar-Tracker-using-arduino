# Solar Tracker Arduino Project Explanation

This document explains how the solar tracking code and hardware work.

## 1. Project Purpose

The goal of this project is to automatically rotate a solar panel toward the direction of maximum sunlight. Two LDR sensors compare light intensity, and the servo rotates toward the brighter side.

## 2. Hardware Used

* Arduino Uno / Nano
* 2 × LDR Sensors
* 2 × 10kΩ Resistors
* Servo Motor
* Jumper wires, breadboard, solar panel (optional)

## 3. Working Logic

1. The Arduino reads light intensity from LDR1 and LDR2.
2. If one side has more light, the servo slowly rotates in that direction.
3. When both values are almost equal, the servo stops.

## 4. Code Flow

* Read LDR values
* Find the difference
* Compare
* Move servo left or right
* Stop when difference is small

## 5. Proteus Simulation

The project can be simulated in Proteus.
Required items:

* Arduino module
* Servo motor module
* Two LDRs
* Resistor network

Upload the same code in Proteus and attach LDRs and servo exactly like real hardware.

## 6. Circuit Explanation

LDRs form a voltage divider and create different analog outputs depending on light. Arduino compares both values.

## 7. Advantages

* Improves solar panel efficiency
* Fully automatic operation
* Low cost

## 8. Applications

* Solar street lights
* Agriculture and irrigation systems
* Educational and research projects
