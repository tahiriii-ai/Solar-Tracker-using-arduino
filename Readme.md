# 🌞 Solar Tracker Using Arduino

This project automatically rotates a servo motor toward the brightest light source using two LDR sensors. It increases the efficiency of solar panels by tracking sunlight throughout the day.

---

## ✅ Features

* Two LDR-based light detection
* Automatic servo rotation
* Smooth tracking movement
* Works on real hardware and Proteus simulation

---

## 🖥 Proteus Simulation

This project can be simulated in Proteus. Components needed:

* Arduino module
* Servo motor
* Two LDRs
* Resistors

Upload the same Arduino code, and the servo will rotate based on simulated light changes.
